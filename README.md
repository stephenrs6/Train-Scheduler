# Train-Scheduler


Similar to a jumbotron at the train station, this application incorporates Moment.js and a simple database to host arrival and departure data. Provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times, and how many minutes from now will the next train arrive. Users may enter additional trains to track.
